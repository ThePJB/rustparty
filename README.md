engine improvments
- do something about a: maybe just start game centered on origin and dont require a
- handle varying number of players


how to fix moving toward each other??
 - maybe need to compare desired rects with one another and figure out compromises

other minigame ideas:
    platofrming race where u can jump on each other, block etc. that would need good collision
    death walls with gaps that slide thru
